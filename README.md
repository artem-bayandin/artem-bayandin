ðŸ¤Œ Since 2009 I've been perfecting my craft in clean code development and architectural design. The journey has taken me through various domains â€” from enterprise software to the exciting realm of Web3. I thrive on challenges and love leading teams to build innovative solutions that make a difference. My British sense of humor often lightens the mood during intense project phases!

- ðŸ‘‰ At Realm.art, I had the opportunity to lead smart contracts development and design secure architectures. The biggest (60+ smart contracts) has passed security audits on the first attempt - a testament to my commitment to quality.
- ðŸ‘‰ Leading full-stack teams has been a significant part of my career since 2015. At SoftTeco, I orchestrated projects that saved around 3 weeks in decision-making processes by aligning stakeholder expectations early on.
- ðŸ‘‰ Prior to that, I crafted comprehensive project approaches, having presented findings to stakeholders. This secured a second development contract and assessed the company as a premier service provider. This experience reinforced my belief in clear communication as a cornerstone of successful project delivery.

Alongside my career, I make a point to give back to the community helping startups launch their ideas into reality. Itâ€™s incredibly rewarding to see ideas come alive and contribute positively to othersâ€™ journeys.
